Projects must increase building energy efficiency by 25%. The base deduction will be $0.50 per square foot, and the deduction can be increased $0.02 for each percentage point increase in energy efficiency, up to $1 per square foot. Bonus deductions can be applied if prevailing wage and apprenticeship requirements are met, increasing the deduction to $2.50 per square foot and increasing by $0.10 for each percentage point increase in energy efficiency, up to $5 per square foot. Building energy efficiency improvements including interior lighting design, heating and cooling systems, ventilation systems, and hot water systems qualify for this deduction.",

A project can also be located in an energy community if it's located in a metropolitan statistical area that has an unemployment rate greater than the previous year's national average unemployment rate and has, or had at any point after 2009, a 0.17% or greater direct fossil fuel employment, or 25% or greater local tax revenues generated from fossil fuel companies. Lastly, a project can qualify for the energy community bonus if it's located near a brownfield site, which is a property that may be complicated by the presence of a hazardous pollutant or contaminant.",10
Low-Income or Native American Land Bonus,"Projects located in a low-income community or on Native American land are eligible for an additional 10% tax credit. Low-income communities are census tracts where at least 20% of the population are below the poverty rate. Low-income communities can also be census tracts where the median family income is below 80% of the statewide or metropolitan area median family income. A project may be on Native American land if it's located within the boundaries of an Indian reservation, held in trust by the United States for the benefit of an Indian tribe, or where a majority of the residents are Native Americans enrolled in a federally recognized Tribe. There are other nuanced qualifications and it's best to consult with an expert to confirm the status of the Native American Land bonus for a project.",10
